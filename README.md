**Customer Churn Prediction (Python, R)	June 2023 - Aug 2023**
-	Designed a model to predict the churning of customers from the given data. Applied Logistic Regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and random forests to predict churn likelihood in customers, evaluating performance

**Forecasting future air passenger traffic using Time series (R, Time series) Sept 2023- Nov 2023**
- Constructed a model for forecasting future air passenger traffic, provided a monthly time series data of air passengers from January 1, 1949, to December 1, 1960,  with each row containing the air passenger number for a month in that respective year. The models used were AR, MA, ARIMA and SARIMA.

**Fake news classification (python, ML) Oct 2023 - Nov 2023**
- Built a model to classify news on Fake and Real news. Text preprocessing included handling null/missing values, encoding categorical data, converting uppercase to lowercase, removing numbers, tokenization, and applying stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization. TF-IDF was employed for feature engineering, and the processed text was fed into machine learning models for prediction.
